Six week course for graduate students at UMass Amherst on using Python and libraries such as Numpy for scientific and numerical computing. I was the sole instructor for this course. I designed the syllabus, recorded and uploaded all lectures and demo sessions, designed and graded all assignments and a final project, and held office hours twice weekly.
