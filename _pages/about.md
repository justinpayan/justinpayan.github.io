I am a PhD student at UMass Amherst, currently advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/). Previously, I worked with [Andrew McCallum](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/) on document representation, citation recommendation, and reviewer assignment. Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University of Georgia, and then was a software engineer at [Vertica](https://www.vertica.com/).

I am most interested in the problem of fairly allocating indivisible resources. I am also working to apply fair allocation algorithms to the reviewer assignment problem. I am generally interested in algorithmic fairness and combinatorial optimization.

My resume is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/jp_resume.pdf).
