I am a 6th year PhD candidate at UMass Amherst, where I apply data science and market design to problems of societal importance, especially in peer review.

I am advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/). Before starting my PhD, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University of Georgia and worked for a year at [Vertica](http://vertica.com) as a software engineer. During my PhD, I have enjoyed interning at Amazon Alexa (2020, 2021), Microsoft (2022), and Adobe Research (2023).

We held a workshop on [Computational Fair Division](https://sites.google.com/view/fairdivisionworkshop/home) at IJCAI 2023, and will be holding it again at IJCAI 2024!

My resume is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/jp_resume.pdf), and my research statement is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/Research_Statement.pdf).
