I am a 6th year PhD candidate at UMass Amherst, where I apply data science and market design to problems of societal importance. 

I am advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/). Before starting my PhD, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University of Georgia and worked for a year at [Vertica](http://vertica.com) as a software engineer. During my PhD, I have enjoyed interning at Amazon Alexa (2020, 2021), Microsoft (2022), and Adobe Research (2023).

We recently held a workshop on [Computational Fair Division](https://sites.google.com/view/fairdivisionworkshop/home) at IJCAI 2023.

I am currently on the academic job market for positions starting Fall 2024. 

My resume is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/jp_resume.pdf), and my research statement is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/Research_Statement.pdf).
