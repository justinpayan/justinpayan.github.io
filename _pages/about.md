I am a 6th year PhD candidate at UMass Amherst, where I work on resource allocation and peer review systems. I am advised by [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/). Before starting my PhD, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University of Georgia and worked for a year at [Vertica](http://vertica.com) as a software engineer. During my PhD, I have enjoyed interning at Amazon Alexa (2020, 2021), Microsoft (2022), and Adobe Research (2023).

My resume is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/jp_resume.pdf).
