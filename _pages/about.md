I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Carnegie Mellon University, where I apply data science and market design to problems of societal importance, especially in peer review. I work in the lab of Prof. [Nihar Shah](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~nihars/).

I recently defended my PhD from UMass Amherst, where my advisor was [Yair Zick](https://people.umass.edu/yzick/). Before starting my PhD, I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees at the University of Georgia and worked for a year at [Vertica](http://vertica.com) as a software engineer. During my PhD, I also enjoyed interning at Amazon Alexa (2020, 2021), Microsoft (2022), and Adobe Research (2023).

We held a workshop on [Computational Fair Division](https://sites.google.com/view/fairdivisionworkshop2024/home) at IJCAI 2023 and 2024!

My resume is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/jp_resume.pdf), and my research statement is available [here](https://justinpayan.github.io/files/Research_Statement.pdf).
